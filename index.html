    <p>Elijah McCoy was the inventor of the lubricating oil cup that allowed railroad steam engines to be lubricated without stopping the train, saving time and money. McCoy was born in Colchester, Ontario, Canada on May 2, 1844. His parents escaped from slavery in Kentucky to Canada on the Underground Railroad. As a child, he became interested in mechanical devices, often taking apart machines and reassembling them. At the age of 15, McCoy was sent by his parents to attend school in Edinburgh, Scotland where he was certified as a mechanical engineer.</p>
    
<p>In 1866, at the age of 22, McCoy returned from Scotland and settled in Ypsilanti, Michigan. At a time immediately following the Civil War, he had difficulty finding a job as an engineer because of his race. Instead of immediately embarking upon the career he had prepared for, McCoy began working for the Michigan Central Railroad as a fireman. His job was to oil the axles, bearings, and other moving parts of the train, when it was stopped, and to shovel coal into the firebox of the cab.</p>
    
<p>While he worked for the Michigan Central Railroad, McCoy also endeavored in a home-based machine shop to develop a way to lubricate the train while it was moving. He came up with an automatic lubricator for oiling the steam engines of locomotives and ships while they were running, enabling them to run faster and more profitably. Called the lubricating cup, or lubricating oil cup, he patented it in 1872.</p>
